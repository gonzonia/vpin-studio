## Release Notes 3.0.6

- **Preferences / Notifications**: Added "Desktop Mode" checkbox for notifications.
- **Table Overview / Table Data Manager**: Optimized dialog so that it can be displayed on 1280x768 screen resolution.

**Bugfixes**

- **VPin Mania**: The actual highscore timestamp is now used when a highscore is written. So when you synchronize your highscores, the actual creation date will be used instead of the date of submission. This way, the "Recent Highscores" widget shows only the actual recently created highscores.
