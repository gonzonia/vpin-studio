## Bugfixes


## VPin Mania

- Added **Delete Table Scores** button to the **Player Statistics** view. This way you can delete e.g. default highscores that have been pushed with your account name. I know this is not an optimal solution yet, but it helps users to at least clean up their own statistics. In the long run, some filtering must be provided to avoid the submission of default scores.
