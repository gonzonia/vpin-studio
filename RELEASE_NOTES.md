## Release Notes 3.12.0

## Changes

- **Tables / PUP Packs**: Added [PupPackScreenTweaker.exe](https://github.com/matiou11/PupPackScreenTweaker) as additional PUP pack editor to the PUP pack section. Note that this editor is only available when working on the cabinet itself.
- **Tables / Table Data Manager**: The auto-naming has no restrictions on VPX files that are located in sub-folders anymore. You can also rename them now.
- **Preferences / Controller Setup**: Added error message that is displayed when "SET FSMODE=EnableTrueFullScreen" is set in the emulator launch script, as this will avoid any VPin Studio overlays from getting the focus.
 
## Bugfixes

- **Tables / PUP Packs**: The PUP pack data in the PUP pack section is now refreshed on table selection.
