## Release Notes 3.0.6

- **Preferences / Notifications**: Added "Desktop Mode" checkbox for notifications.

**Bugfixes**

- **VPin Mania**: The actual highscore timestamp is now used when a highscore is written. So when you synchronize your highscores, the actual creation date will be used instead of the date of submission. This way, the "Recent Highscores" widget shows only the actual recently created highscores.
