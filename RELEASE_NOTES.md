## Release Notes 3.0.7

**This version is a re-release of version 3.0.6.**

Version 3.0.6 ran into a fatal error because after the automatic update to the latest virtual pinball spreadsheet database, the returned
database file contained one backglass file entry with an empty id which broke the whole table loading.

The Studio has been made more robust here and the VPS team has been notified.
