## Release Notes 3.0

We are happy to announce that VPin Studio version 3.0 has been released.

### PinballX Support

The VPin Studio supports **PinballX** now too! The feature set is a bit more limited than the one for PinUP Popper users
but the basic scoring and asset management functionalities are there.
Because of the larger user base, PinUP Popper will remain the main focus. But depending on the feedback we get, 
the feature set of PinballX will be extended too.

In addition to that, the VPin Studio installer supports a **Standalone** mode too.
This mode does not support media management but all other basic VPX based features.

You can select between the three modes (PinUP Popper, PinballX and Standalone) when installing the Studio.
