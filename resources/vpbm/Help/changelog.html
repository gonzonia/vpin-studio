    <h3><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;VPBM Change Log</span></h3>
    <dl>
        <dt><strong>Version 3.2</strong></dt>
        <dd>
            <li>Bugfix to address cases where generated temp files are deleted between runs and force rescan is not enabled to ensure they are recreated as needed.</li>
        </dd>
        <dt><strong>Version 3.1</strong></dt>
        <dd>
            <li>Updated auto-updater to work on systems without 7Zip installed.</li>
            <li>MSI installer updated to cleanup version and icon.</li>
            <li>Added checks for invalid backup paths in config on first load to ensure cleaner GUI handling.</li>
            <li>Added menu option to help menu to raise tickets.</li>
            <li>Cleaned up some docco typos.</li>
        </dd>
        <dt><strong>Version 3.0</strong></dt>
        <dd>
            <li>
                Added new 'Alternate Host' functionality which is configured on the <a href="./applicationSettings.html">Application Settings</a> window and allows backup to be shared between up to 3 hosts, rather than requiring multiple export versions to be created. This feature will ultimately replace the Export functionality, with GUI version of VPBM already removing the export button.
            </li>
			<li>All new backups have the ability (using alternate hosts) to be processed on the host they are generated on plus 2 other hosts - thse additional two hosts are now shown in the
			<a href="./selectedGameDisplayControl.html">Selected Game Display Control Panel</a> panel if they have been defined.
			</li>
			<li>Added new Emulator and Filter Settings menu item under the file menu. This launches the <a href="./emulatorAndFilterSettings.html">Emulator and Filter Settings</a> window which allows users to view all currently defined filters for each emulator type and add new filters as required.</li>
			<li>Refactored settings changes to reduce the need for an application restart to just the case where the underlying <strong>Pinup System</strong> path has changed.</li>
            <li>Bugfix to support games with multiple file extensions.</li>
            <li>Bugfix to support duplicate emulators set up via use of templates to ensure correct detection of game codes.</li>
       </dd>
        <dt><strong>Version 2.7</strong></dt>
        <dd>
            <li>Bugfix to support games with names containing trailing spaces prior to the extenson, ie "gameName  .vpx".</li>
            <li>Bugfix to support game with a variety of newline characters used in game scripts.</li>
        </dd>
        <dt><strong>Version 2.6</strong></dt>
        <dd>
            <li>Bugfix to address case where right clicking on root node of the content browser would result in application crashing.</li>
        </dd>
        <dt><strong>Version 2.5</strong></dt>
        <dd>
            <li>Adds code to workaround cases where Pinup Popper game setup has been updated to set inconsistent <strong>Game FileName</strong>, and <strong>FileName</strong> values. <strong>Game FileName</strong> is used by Pinup for naming Pinup media, while <strong>FileName</strong> is used by Pinup to create this media, as well as aligning the actual game filenames. Previously VPBM was using the value of <strong>Game FileName</strong> to populate the <strong>[GAMENAME]</strong> variable, but this meant that tables that had been renamed, may not get found by VPBM filters.</li>
        </dd>
        <dt><strong>Version 2.4</strong></dt>
        <dd>
            <li>Minor bug patch addressing issue impacting new Orphaned Content Manager loading if unexpected game manifests exist.</li>
        </dd>
        <dt><strong>Version 2.3</strong></dt>
        <dd>
            <li>Minor bug patch addressing an issue by which filtering the installed games to an empty list could result in issues occuring.</li>
        </dd>
        <dt><strong>Version 2.2</strong></dt>
        <dd>
            <li>Enhanced ability to backup/restore/delete individual file content (added in Version 2.1) from installed games or backup files rather than requiring full game backup/restores to bring games in synch. These options are available in the <strong>Selected Game Content</strong>, <strong>Selected Game Filter Variables</strong>, <strong>Selected Game Custom Filters</strong> and <strong>Selected Game Pinup Details</strong> panels when differences are found between backup and installed games.</li>
            <li>Replaced toggle buttons with radio buttons in the Selected Game Display Control panel to make selected option clearer.</li>
            <li>Added a [GAMEFOLDER] filter variable which can be used to represent the path to a game from the emulator base directory - this is extracted from the <strong>Games Folder</strong> stored within Pinup System for the games emulator and any specific game path stored in the games <strong>Filename</strong> value.</li>
            <li>Added better description of how to copy game variables to new custom filters.</li>
            <li>Added a <strong>Refresh All</strong> button to the main <strong>Installed Games</strong> panel to avoid the need to use the <strong>File</strong> menu.</li>
            <li>Added checks for CSV, XML, and VPReg content when determining files used by other games in delete operations.</li>
            <li>Added description of offset file used in <strong>Selected Game Content</strong> panel when game is currently using an offset file for NVRAM.</li>
            <li>Added support for games stored in sub-folders of an emulators main <strong>Games Folder</strong> as configured in Pinup System.</li>
            <li>Added the <strong>Orphaned Content Manager</strong> dialog under <strong>Utilities</strong> menu to present user ability to locate and manage game files not currently being used.</li>
            <li>Added the <strong>Force Rescan of All Games at Startup</strong> setting which is enabled by default (this is the original behaviour). Users can now disable this behaviour, meaning that at startup, games are only scanned if VPBM does not detect details of a previous scan. When enabled, all previous scan results are removed meaning all games are re-scanned.</li>
        </dd>
        <dt><strong>Version 2.1</strong></dt>
        <dd>
            <li>Added functionality to allow backup/restore/delete of individual content from backups and system.</li>
