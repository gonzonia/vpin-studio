    <h3><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;What is Virtual Pinball Backup Manager</span></h3>
    <p>Virtual Pinball Backup Manager (<span class="vpbm">VPBM</span>) is designed to manage backups of individual Virtual Pinball games within a Pinup System/Baller Installer installation.</p>
    <p><span class="vpbm">VPBM</span> currently supports Visual Pinball (VPX) and Future Pinball emulators.</p>
    <p><span class="vpbm">VPBM</span> supports backup and restore of a wide range of game related content, including:
    <ul>
        <li>Pinup System specific
            <ul>
                <li>Pinup database settings</li>
                <li>Pinup media files</li>
                <li>Pup Packs</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>VPX specific
            <ul>
                <li>B2S (backglass) files</li>
                <li>B2S settings</li>
                <li>POV (point-of-view) files</li>
                <li>Flex DMD/Ultra DMD files and folders</li>
                <li>VPReg.stg entries</li>
                <li>Custom user text files</li>
                <li>VPinMAME ROMs</li>
                <li>VpinMAME VPMAlias.txt entries</li>
                <li>VPinMAME altcolor and altsound</li>
                <li>VPinMAME NVRAM (including offset handling)</li>
                <li>All stored game specific registry settings found in 'Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Freeware\Visual PinMame'</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Future Pinball specific
            <ul>
                <li>Game libraries - (via custom filters)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    </br>
    <strong>NOTE: Additional filter rules can be setup by users to include additional content not met by the default rules</strong>

    <p>The contents of a games backup can easily be viewed within the application using the tree view, while an integrated <strong>Quick View</strong> bar provides users a quick visual indication of the presence of critical files.</p>
    <p>Pinup database game details are displayed, as is Pinup media, in a manner consistent with how media is displayed within Pinup Menu Setup.</p>
    <p><span class="vpbm">VPBM</span> is not designed to replace <a href="https://www.nailbuster.com/wikipinup/doku.php?id=start">Pinup System</a>, in fact it depends on it to function - rather it tries to add features that make managing game files and settings easier by providing an individual game backup and support for comparing this backup to the installed game.</p>
    <p><span class="vpbm">VPBM</span> has been designed to quickly highlight to users when a games backup has fallen out of synch with the currently installed version of the game, allowing users to use the functions provides to address the inconsistencies.</p>
    <p><span class="vpbm">VPBM</span> backup files are encrypted and locked to the machine that they were created on, however a mechanism is provided to export games to a known external system. For infromation on this feature, refer to the <strong>Export Path</strong> and <strong>Export Host Identifier</strong> settings described at <a href="./applicationSettings.html">Application Settings</a>. This process does not allow games to be exported and shared universally.</p>
    <p>Integrated help is provided, with the various menus and application panels making up the application each having their own help buttons. Quick links to this help is provided below.</p>

    <h3><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Download & Installation</span></h3>
    <p>Download the latest stable release of <span class="vpbm">VPBM</span> from the <a href="https://github.com/mmattner/vPinBackupManagerApp/releases/latest">releases section</a> of the <span class="vpbm">VPBM</span> Github repo. The self installing MSI is used for a clean installation.</p>
	<p>Once installed a self updater will check for available updates upon startup and allow the user to trigger an update (see Updates section below).
    <br />

    <h3><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Installing Updates</span></h3>
    <p><span class="vpbm">VPBM</span> contains built in update functionality. At startup, if connected to the internet, <span class="vpbm">VPBM</span> searches for any available updates. If an update is found, VPBM displays an indication of the update in the status bar.</p>

    <br />
    <img src="img/vpbmApplicationUpdate.jpg" width="576" alt="VPBM Application Update">
    <br />
    <br />
    <p>Clicking on the red text in the status bar will trigger a dialog confirming you wish to proceed with the update and provide two methods of performing the update - automatic and manual.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>An automatic update requires a single button click, but could present issues if Antivirus or Windows Defender block the update zip being downloaded from <a href=https://github.com/mmattner/vPinBackupManagerApp/releases/latest>https://github.com/mmattner/vPinBackupManagerApp/releases/latest</a>.</li>
        <li>A manual update provides the user a set of steps to manually download the update pack and manually check it before performing the update with a supplied install script. To assist with this process the above link is copied into the clipboard for the user to paste into their browser of choice.</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <img src="img/vpbmApplicationUpdateConfirmation.jpg" width="583" alt="VPBM Application Update Confirmation">
    <br />
    <br />
    <p>Clicking Yes launches the auto updater. As per the description the updater will take several minutes to complete (depending on internet speed). During this time <span class="vpbm">VPBM</span> will download the appropriate update zip (as found <a href="https://github.com/mmattner/vPinBackupManagerApp/releases/latest">here</a>) before shutting down, unzipping the update and restarting.</p>
    <p>If the user clicks No, they are prevented a dialog containing the steps to perform a manual download (shown below). At this point they can either click OK and ignore the steps, or they can work through the steps to update the application version.</p>
