    <h3><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Overview</span></h3>
    <p>The <strong>Selected Game Pinup Details</strong> panel provides a read only view of the currently selected games details. This information mirrors the information found within the Pinup Popper Games Manager, but is a read only copy of this information.</p>
    <p>Users wishing to modify game data seen in this panel should do this through Pinup Popper as the scope of <span class="vpbm">VPBM</span> is limited to the management of game backups rather than editing game data.</p>
    <p>The source of information viewed in this panel is determined by the selections made in the <a href="./selectedGameDisplayControl.html">Selected Game Display Control</a> panel.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>If <strong>Disk</strong> is selected, the displayed content is taken from the currently active Pinup Popper database.</li>
        <li>If <strong>Backup</strong> is selected, the displayed content is taken from the currently games backup file.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Content within the <strong>Selected Game Pinup Details</strong> panel will be colored red if the content differs between the installed game and database, or green if the content is only present in the installed game or database. </p>

	<h3><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Backup and Restore of Pinup Details</span></h3>
	<p>When Pinup details are found to contain differences between the system and the backup, it is possible to perform a backup or restore of just the Pinup details - saving the need to perform another full game backup or restore.</p>
	<p>When differences have been detected, the <strong>Selected Game Pinup Details</strong> panel border is highlighted in an error colour. The examples below show the case where the <strong>Game Theme</strong> and <strong>ROM</strong> values are out of synch.</p>
	<p>Depending on whether the current or backup filter variables are being displayed, a <strong>Backup Values</strong> or <strong>Restore Values</strong> button is provided in the top right corner of the panel to allow the selected games Pinup details to be backed up or restored - as seen below.</p>
	<p>Pressing <strong>Backup Values</strong> or <strong>Restore Values</strong> button  will backup or restore the selected games Pinup details.</p>
