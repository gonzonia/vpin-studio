    <h3><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Overview</span></h3>
    <p>The <strong>Selected Game Pinup Media Panel</strong> panel provides a read only view of the currently selected games Pinup Popper media is a style consistent with the Pinup Popper Media Manager display. This information mirrors the information found within the Pinup Popper Games Manager.</p>
    <p>Users wishing to modify Pinup Popper media seen in this panel should do this through Pinup Popper as the scope of <span id="vpbm">VPBM</span> is limited to the management of game backups rather than editing game data.</p>
    <p>The colour of media status buttons reflects the presence of Pinup Media of that type.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>A green status button indicates that media was found.</li>
        <li>A yellow status button indicates that no media was found.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Clicking on a green media status button will expand the tree view in the <a href="./selectedGameContent.html">Selected Game Content</a> panel to navigate to the media type that has been clicked on.</p>
    <p>The source of information viewed in this panel is determined by the selections made in the <a href="./selectedGameDisplayControl.html">Selected Game Display Control</a> panel.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>If <strong>Disk</strong> is selected, the displayed content is taken from the currently active Pinup Popper database.</li>
