## Developers

To build either B2S.Server or B2S.Designer open the *.sln files in Visual Studio (any version from 2019 should work) and select **build**->**Build Solution** in the menu.
Microsoft has VM's prepared which includes Windows 11 and Visual Studio in one bundle. The license for these normally lasts 3 months each. This is an easy way to test if it works out without having to install many different components.
